# Notes

## Introduction

motivation: c.f. Pierre email - programmers write lot, read less; vs architects the other way round
this is an attempt to show how to read?

## Possibility of critical language

Double coding
Jencks - p9, 40

Critical language
oppositions 376 - much of architecture comments on existing discourses

see ways of criticism (Oppositions, p372)

what is critical? jencks p150

but we have to make things more visible
  if it is speaking only to programmers reading code, it is not much use
achieving greater transparency - smalltalk, web, open source (c.f. grant)

manipulate language / formal codes - oppositions p376

self-referentiality to build more meaning
  (risks danger of intellectualism)

contrast double coding - one meaning for the building, one for the viewer
(one for computer, one for the human)

metaphorical operation (grid c.f. abstraction!
  relate grid in city with grid in floorplan cf oppositions)

operate on codes (Oppositions 377, c.f. chicago column)

use pavilions/stage sets to show what capitalism has
taken away from us on a small scale
c.f. heterotopias (Jencks)

performative science fiction

what can house/software express besides its function?

see Oppositions 376

more methodological freedom!
(build silly things; needed for deconstruction etc.)

eclecticism? pop? learning from las vegas?

PM liberated communicative potential - dtto! (Jencks)

! need to see inside things, which is why programming systems perspective matters
(in a house, you can talk through the internal structure, as long as it functions)

but SW is more than code - also docs etc. - take broader perspective!
(community etc.)

monuments / demoscene / esolangs / talks / hackathons
(building as ritualistic activity to encourage social bonds - Aureli)

Also SW parks and monuments to try formal ideas

## Conclusions

PM liberated communicative potential (Jencks) - how to do this for PL?

## Random

Some AI art projects that question how it works (e.g. guess your age?)
as an example of a minimal way of revealing what's going on inside

loft as another proof that geometric structure can be reused (c.f. ice rinks)

architecture = concept/intent, function (modernist), structure, technics (19th cent), form
- each of these is the paradigm of some language!
(from Eisenman introduction)

grammar of architecture is useful for conceiving project but it is a fiction - Eisenman (Petit, 149)

follow mechanical process (ad absurdum?)

Read https://parametric-architecture.com/deconstructing-deconstruction-the-architectural-philosophy-of-peter-eisenman/

eisenmann - formal order to render architecture transparent

abstract entity to support any kind of activity (Aureli)

Eisenman - Wexner center - grid becomes external

multiple coding see https://stars.library.ucf.edu/elo2020/asynchronous/proceedingspapers/17/

double coding - c.f. minification - removes one sense?
also auto formatters - remove some degree of freedom / code poetry

eisenmann - use formal order to render architecture transparent
follies - https://www.theartstory.org/movement/deconstructivism/

Slow software (tomasp blog)


Cartesian grid as first class - reveal technique
-> political significance of the grid (Aureli); challenge reading grid as rational system
mis-leading axonometric drawings (Eisenmann)
-> plans as the device (does not have to be built)
basic L shape as critique of modernist simple building blocks
-> DECONSTRUCTION

ALSO contemporary thinking architecture - local materials etc.
=> dtto for SW! (build sustainably)

## Pop culture

Sources for new socially relevant language (Oppositions 329)
(Oppositions, 656,  667)

discussion - learning from las vegas
vs. should speculate what society should be


## Space and navigation

inhabiting, terrain vague, navigating in systems

c.f. relationship to cities in Possibility of Absolute architecture

## Materiality

* looks bad before goes bad
* materials - become ornament (Jencks, 183)
* material honesty (Depaz)
* problems of traditional materials are well-understood (Brand, p118) - you can use SW with known bugs

## Achieving fit

* eisenmann - must become effect: https://eisenmanarchitects.com/Fin-D-Ou-T-Hou-S-1983
  (cf. petit 148, eisenmann phd)

## Ornament

* decorated shed - typescript, structure becomes ornament - APL

## Abstraction

* as arising from human world?
* we deny that abstraction is a reflection of larger historical and cultural forces (Aureli, vii)
* abstractions are concrete, emerge from tangle of human actions (Aureli, ix)
* not due to strucutre, but due to the way it is produced (division of labor, etc.) (Aureli, x)

* fully abstract - how buildings enclose space (Aurelli)
* fully abstract in that it forces no specific use (Co-op interior)
-> how much structure SW forces on us?

## Complexity

* Jacobs, Venturi (Jencks, 116)

## Self-referentiality

* shapes that do not refer to something else (just other shapes) (Oppositions, 205)
* return to language (Oppositions, 373); layers of signification
* LANGUAGE, GRAMMAR

## Post-modernism

* complexity, plurality of meaning (Venturi) - as reaction to modernism (Oppositions, 202)
* a mechanism for critically reflecting on history
  (c.f. column with gap as decoration; reverse meaning)

## Deconstruction

* deconstruct all methodologies without replacing them with a new one
  (but Derrida's criticism of Eisenmann in Chora L Works)

## Grammar

* Bruneleschi - origins (Aureli) - enables "building out of time"
* c.f. Eisenmann

## Monuments

* cf. Aureli
