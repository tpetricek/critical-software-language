\chapter{Introduction}

The name of the architect Christopher Alexander is perhaps better known in programming
circles than among architects,\endnote{RPG, Steenson} so he makes for the perfect opening
of a text that draws parallels between the world of architecture and the world of software.
But let me be clear that I reference Alexander not to draw inspiration from his work
for better software design, but to highlight a question that he posed about software.

In 1996, the organizers of the annual ACM Conference on Object-Oriented Programs, Systems,
Languages and Applications (OOPSLA) invited the Christopher Alexander to deliver
the keynote talk. This was not an incidental invitation. By the mid-1990s, Alexander's ideas
on pattern languages and design patterns were already influential in the computer science and
software engineering circles and many of those involved in bringing Alexander's ideas into the
world of software were regular participants at OOPSLA.

In his keynote, Alexander talked about his lifelong quest for creating living structures
in the world, i.e., beautiful structures where each element is in harmony with each other,
structures that evolve well and reflect natural inclinations of their human inhabitants.
In the last part of his talk, Alexander called upon the attendees to take responsibility
for the built environment and tackle the problem of generating living structures.
As Alexander pointed out, the idea of generative process is natural to computer scientists
and so they are well equipped for the task.

Alexander commented on a perceived ``undercurrent of unease as to where all
this---software design---is going''. In a ``very direct and blunt'' comment, he suggests that:

\begin{quote}
It could be thought that the technical way in which you [computer scientists] currently look at
programming is almost as if you were willing to be ``guns for hire.'' In other words, you are the
technicians. You know how to make the programs work. ``Tell us what to do daddy, and we'll do it.''
That is the worm in the apple.
\end{quote}

One could conclude that computer scientists and programmers share their predicament with architects
who, as argued by Charles Jencks\endnote{p26} ``have little power, [and] are not in any better
position to command what is built.'' Perhaps like architects, computer scientists and programmers
being ``fairly low in the chain of command and needing jobs, are prone to compromise with the
state and the establishment.''

I think that this is not the case. I believe that, on a more basic level, programming,
computer science and software development lack the critical language that is needed for thinking
about the problem. In other words, regardless of whether we have the power to command what is built,
we do not know how to critically question what is built, how to imagine alternatives, and how to
ironically poke at the undesirable characteristics of what is being built.

\section{Critical Language for Software}
This text is an attempt to develop such critical language of software. To do so, I will draw on
a number of architects and architectural critics. Their work provides an inspiration for
what, I believe, is needed for software. Some of those critiques are in the form of written text,
but more notably, architects also use building plans and buildings themselves to raise important
points about architecture. I believe we, programmers and computer scientists, similarly need to
find ways of designing software that not only fulfils a certain function, but also raises critical
questions. I acknowledge a certain irony in my effort, because what you are looking at is itself
text---and not a piece of software.

Although I started with Alexander's comment and I share his belief that programmers and computer
scientists should not accept the role of ``guns for hire,'' my thinking follows a different
route than that suggested by Alexander---one that would likely not make Christopher Alexander
himself very happy.\endnote{Alexander Eisenmann debate \url{https://arahovsepyan.com/eisenmanalexander}}
Rather than seeking a way of building that achieves a living structure, I turn to critical
debates on architecture that emerged from post-modern critical architecture and debates about it.

Even if our ultimate goal as programmers and computer scientists was to produce ``living
structures'' in the world, I do not think we can achieve this without first having a critical
language that lets us reflect on our work, criticise existing approaches, deconstruct our creations
and look for alternative arrangements.

In other words, I believe there is a value in exploring disharmony\endnote{Agreeing with Eisenmann
in the debate} and in using a critical language of architecture---or in my case of software---to
criticise the state of the discipline and imagine new ways of thinking and new ways in which
software can support social structures.
Although I mainly look to writing on post-modern architecture for sources of inspiration,
the idea is by no means new. We can trace similar ideas to the rise of modernism in Europe
following the First World War when some architects ``overwhelemed by the nightmare of
industrialization (...) briefly speculate on alternative condition'':\endnote{Oppositions -- p52, p55}

\begin{quote}
It is not the crazy caprice of a poet that glass architecture will bring a new culture.
It is a fact. (\ldots) Therefore the European is right when he fears that glass architecture
might become uncomfortable. Certainly it will be so. And that is not its least advantage.
For first of all the European must be wrenched out of his coziness.
\end{quote}

On the next couple of pages, I will look at three examples from post-modern architecture that
highlight some of the aspects of the critical language developed by architects that I hope
to create for software.

\section{The Ironical Column}
To illustrate some of the ways through which architects use architecture to communicate,
I start with the most basic structural element, the column. Figure~\ref{fig:columns} shows
several uses of columns, starting from the ancient Parthenon built in Athens in 5th century
BC followed by four examples that include a reference to the classical column.\endnote{See
also Korman ``The Architecture of the Facade'' - for more on columns}

Neoclassical architecture, influential from the late 18th century, looks back to the Classical
past. It sees it uncritically, as a source of pure geometric order with ideal proportions and
symmetry. Such references to the ancients should not be unexpected. At the start of the 17th
century, ancient philosophers were seen as the source of truth that was partly lost and needs
to be recovered, but that was already fully known to the ancients.\endnote{Wootton} The
scientific revolution of the 17th century gradually changed this view in what was becoming
experimental science, but it should not be a surpirse that architects of the 18th century were
looking back to ancient structures that were becoming rediscovered and better understood at the
time. Neoclassical architecture remained influential after the 18th century, but its meaning
slowly shifted. It turned from an attempt to rediscover and recreate ideal structures to an
idealized style that emphasises tradition. The use of the style for many US federal buildings
is thus a reference to the values that the style encompasses.\endnote{Also conservative
``Executive Order on Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture'' -- Trump's administration (2020)}

The modernist Villa Savoye designed by Le Corbusier also looks back to the Classical past,
but it does so in a very different way. Rather than directly copying the style and order of the
ancient Greek temples, the building is a reinterpretation of the ideas of a Greek
temple.\endnote{Unwin - Twenty-Five Buildings Every Architect Should Understand}
Following modernist focus on function, Le Corbusier's design gives prominence to the automobile
(parked on the ground floor). It reimagines the ideal structure of Greek temple based on
geometric principles (using the golden ratio), but replaces ancient Greek columns with
minimalistic modernist pilotis. Although the same historical reference is present in Villa Savoye,
it is present at a more conceptual level and may not be initially apparent.

The importance of the column as an icon representing a certain style of architecture was well
understood by other modernist architects, including Adolf Loos who is best known as the author
of the modernist manifesto ``Ornament and Crime'', first presented as a lecture in 1910.
In his entry for the Chicago Tribune Tower competition in 1922, Loos made yet another reference
to the ancient Greek temple and shaped the entire building as a giant Doric column. Loos himself
did not view the column as ornamental and instead saw it as supporting the public nature of the
building with appropriate symbolism.\endnote{Krul - Adolf Loos and the Doric Order}
The structure of the building itself here becomes the symbol in a way that is reminiscent
of later post-modernist works where construction patterns and material textures themselves become
ornament.\endnote{Jencks, p183} Despite being rooted in the modernist thinking, the Chicago Tribune
Tower project became an inspiration for later post-modern architects who make more or less subtle
historical references in an ironic way. They will include columns in their buildings to indicate
that they recognize being a part of architectural culture and tradition, but they no longer need
columns as structural support mechanisms.

A good illustration of the ironic reference is the facade created by Hans Hollein for the 1980
Venice Biennale. The event took place in Corderia of the Arsenale, a large historical building
itself featuring supporting columns. The participants of the Biennale were asked to design a
facade for their exhibition that would cover (and hide) the historical structure of the Corderia.
Hollein did the exact opposite. He complemented two columns of the Corderia with a range of
ironical forms of columns. One was a bushy tree cut into the shape of a column, while another was
a scaled-down version of Loos' Chicago Tribune Tower. The entrance into the exhibition was under
a hanging fragment of a column, which clearly lost its original structural function. Here, the
ironical use of the architectural language is clear.\endnote{Branscombe - Hans Hollein and
Postmodernism}

Hollein's entry addressed the theme of the
Biennale, ``The Presence of the Past'' in a way that is funny and ironic, but sends a clear
message about history and continuity of architecture. It also illustrates the changing function
of a column (from supporting structure to a decoration above exhibition entrance). Moreover, the
ironical style of the presentation, shared with many other post-modern architectural works, makes
the message accessible and engaging for broader public. Hollein's facade is interesting for
yet another reason. It uses architectural language to communicate architectural ideas, but it
is neither text, nor a building. As we will see repeatedly, built structures such as stage sets
or monuments are often interesting media through which critical architectural ideas can be
expressed.

The column takes yet another form in the addition to the Allen Memorial Art Museum designed by
Robert Venturi in 1977. The extension itself is based on an idea that Venturi refers to as
the ``decorated shed''. The basic structure and spatial disposition of the building itself is
simple and serves its function which was, in part, to provide more storage space.
Any symbolic, cultural and aesthetic meaning is provided ``by modifying the basic shell by means
of design decisions of a second order.''\endnote{Oppositions, p182} One such second-order
decision is the addition of isolated iconic elements, such as the mock Ionic column that
marks the building as cultural institution. In a way, the column serves similar role as the
neoclassical architecture of the US National Archives, but is here added merely as an ironic
decoration. The association of ancient Greek columns with important public buildings remains,
but is told in a very different way.

ironic historical reference - critical of neoclassicism
change of function, repurpose
exhibition - stage set / pavilons, allows for communication
reveal inherent conflicts
ironically distort regularity - point out things
change of function - non-structural (decorated shed)
irony valued for superior depth, allows showing multiple contradictory views (Jencks, 79)
intellectual reference to other works vs. funny reference for broader public - to engage with wider audience!

\section{Towards Ironical Software}

point out things that we're doing without thinking (information hiding)
-> expose structure

highlight contradictions - plenty in software

exhibitions / stage sets
-> format for communication

engage with audience in a fun way?




\newpage

HOW CAN IT BE DONE

self-referentiality to build more meaning
  (risks danger of intellectualism)

contrast double coding - one meaning for the building, one for the viewer
(one for computer, one for the human)

metaphorical operation (grid c.f. abstraction!
  relate grid in city with grid in floorplan cf oppositions)

operate on codes (Oppositions 377, c.f. chicago column)

use pavilons/stage sets to show what capitalism has
taken away from us on a small scale
c.f. heterotopias (Jencks)

performative science fiction

what can house/software express besides its function?

see Oppositions 376

more methodological freedom!
(build silly things; needed for deconstruction etc.)

eclecticism? pop? learning from las vegas?

PM liberated communicative potential - dtto! (Jencks)

! need to see inside things, which is why programming systems perspective matters
(in a house, you can talk through the internal structure, as long as it functions)

\section{Leftovers}

POP/LAS VEGAS
Sources for new socially relevant language (Oppositions 329)
(Oppositions, 656,  667)
discussion - learning from las vegas
vs. should speculate what society should be


THREE EXAMPLES FOR INTRO
* something formal geometrical (abstract)
  - abstraction
  - more followers of modernism
  - memorial
  - pinwheel bauhaus building - formal mirrors school strcutrue (Eisenmann thesis last chapter)
  - plazas become ice skating rinks (no need for functional motivation, Oppositions 67)
* something post-modern - saying things with architecture
* chiat
* deconstruction?
*


maybe one monument?

INTRODUCTION
* Alexander's hired guns
* limited options of architect (Jencks?)
* we lack the language for answering alexander's question
* New glass architecture must wrench the European out of his coziness (Oppositions, 55)
* c.f. architecture as bloodless pseudo-science (Oppositions, xii)
  totaliarization of technique (Frampton) - how to escape?
* irony (operate in a system to which one is critical)
* structure that enables things (Venturi, 13; Tufekci)
* social visions - but how to phrase? plans, monuments
* learning from - las vegas (or opposing it; Oppositions 656); manhattan
* \#1 - eisenman (deconstruction)
* \#2 - postmodern (speaking)
* \#3 - venturi - what is vs. what should be

SPACE/NAVIGATING
* inhabiting, terrain vague, navigating in systems

MATERIALITY
* looks bad before goes bad
* materials - become ornament (Jencks, 183)
ACHIEVING FIT
*

ABSTRACTION
* as arising from human world?
* we deny that abstraction is a reflection of larger historical and cultural forces (Aureli, vii)
* abstractions are concrete, emerge from tangle of human actions (Aureli, ix)
* not due to strucutre, but due to the way it is produced (division of labor, etc.) (Aureli, x)

COMPLEXITY
* Jacobs, Venturi (Jencks, 116)

SELF-REFERENTIALITY
* "shapes that do not refer to something else (just other shapes)" (Oppositions, 205)
* return to language (Oppositions, 373); layers of signification
* LANGUAGE, GRAMMAR

POST-MODERNISM
* complexity, plurality of meaning (Venturi) - as reaction to modernism (Oppositions, 202)
* a mechanism for critically reflecting on history
  (c.f. column with gap as decoration; reverse meaning)

DECONSTRUCTION
* deconstruct all methodologies without replacing them with a new one
  (but Derrida's criticism of Eisenmann in Chora L Works)

GRAMMAR
* Bruneleschi - origins (Aureli) - enables "building out of time"
* c.f. Eisenmann

SELF-REFERENTIALITY / LANGUAGE / DECONSTRUCTION II
* fully abstract - how buildings enclose space (Aurelli)
* fully abstract in that it forces no specific use (Co-op interior)
-> how much structure SW forces on us?

PLANS / MONUMENTS
* cf. Aureli


SLOW SOFTWARE

Cartesian grid as first class - reveal technique
-> political significance of the grid (Aureli); challenge reading grid as rational system
mis-leading axonometric drawings (Eisenmann)
-> plans as the device (does not have to be built)
basic L shape as critique of modernist simple building blocks
-> DECONSTRUCTION
